>There is an issue with winetricks downloading corefonts atm. If you are experiencing this issue and see any reference to corefonts in the output installing these launchers or any other game, you will need to clear the folder listed below and manually copy the font from the web link here to the appropriate folder and run the install again. As always, make sure you are running lutris 0.5.13/14 and have the latest wine-ge 8.x (currently 17) installed in lutris using the wine folder under the runnerâ€¦

>You missed the piece that said make sure you have wine ge 8.17 installed in lutris. On the left hand panel in lutris under runners, highlight wine and click on the folder icon beside it. Select the most recent wine ge (should still be 8.17) and install it. Retry installation
